# AS A business owner I want 
to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company so that I can organize and plan my business. 

# WHEN I start the application
then I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role when I choose to view all departments then I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids
